# Library Management System
Console application for managing a library of books.

## Assumptions
- Currently we only storing the book title and author
- Currently we can only have 1 of each book (no multiple copies of a book with the same title and author)
## Future Improvements
- Don't allow users to enter the same book twice.
- Allow the ability to store copies of a book e.g. a book  can have multiple copies of different types (1 title, multiple copies) e.g. hard copy or audiobook
- List all books: Add pagination
- Add logging
